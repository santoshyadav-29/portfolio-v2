My journey into **web development** began a year ago, and back then, I had little knowledge about the vast world of web development. I was excited but also somewhat frightened. I embarked on this journey as a self-driven learner, relying on random video courses. Looking back, I can't help but recall the initial fear of failing to grasp the complexities of web development.

<h1> Initial Struggle as a Self-driven Learner
</h1>

One of the biggest challenges I faced was inconsistency in my learning process. I often found myself switching courses and postponing my studies to an uncertain future. Concepts like **_DOM manipulation and Promises_** made me think if I had what it took to understand this concepts. And there was so many terms like **_bundler, webpack, vite, frameworks, library’s_** etc and the list goes on and on. Initially it looked like I will never be able to learn all of the things I often doubted my abilities, thinking that I might be lacking something essential to comprehend these concepts. Problem was I was not following a structured course and didn’t took much of a help from the people who already knew this things as I didn’t wanted to look small. Now it seems what an Idiot I was to think something like that.

# The Turning Point

Amidst these struggles, I discovered a lifeline that would change the course of my journey. **_Kevin Powell's YouTube channel_** on CSS became a revelation. His teaching style helped me gain a deep understanding of CSS, and suddenly, a significant source of frustration transformed into a source of confidence. I realized that I could design any complex layout. But the real game-changer was a **_course by Anjana Vakil on JavaScript_**. Her course laid the foundation for my understanding of JavaScript. To be frank I got most of my knowledge on web from other youtuber, courses, documentations. But This two developer help me fall in love with the web dev and made my learning journey a lot smother.
